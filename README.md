👋 Hi, I'm Younes RAMCHOUN
AI & Data Science Engineer | Master's Student @ INSEA
🧠 I'm passionate about designing and building intelligent, data-driven applications that solve real-world problems. My core interests lie in Generative AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision.
⚙️ What I'm Currently Working On
I am currently developing an advanced Intelligent Document Processing platform for my Master's thesis (PFE). This project is a deep dive into state-of-the-art AI architectures, featuring:
A hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture combining multiple retrieval strategies.
Knowledge Graphs (Neo4j) for structured and relational data retrieval.
Vector Databases (PostgreSQL/pgvector) for high-performance semantic search.
GenAI orchestration with LangChain4j and Spring AI.
Integration of local LLMs & VLMs (Llama3, Phi3) via Ollama.
A full-stack implementation with a Java/Spring Boot backend, an Angular frontend, and containerized with Docker.
🛠️ Skills & Technologies
AI & Machine Learning: Generative AI (RAG, LLMs), NLP, Computer Vision (CNNs), Deep Learning, Scikit-learn
Languages: Python, Java, SQL, C
Backend & Development: Spring Boot, Spring AI, API RESTful, Docker
Databases: PostgreSQL (pgvector), Neo4j, MySQL
Frameworks & Tools: LangChain4j, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, Git, GitHub
Deployment & Cloud: Docker, Tomcat, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm always open to collaborating on innovative projects in AI, especially those involving Generative AI, MLOps, or applied Data Science. Feel free to reach out!
